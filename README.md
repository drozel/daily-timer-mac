# Daily Timer for macOS

A simple macOS timer app built in Swift using SwiftUI.  
Designed to run daily standups efficiently by timing each team member.

> ⚠️ This was my first Swift project — developed quickly to improve my daily life as engineering manager. I’m not a professional Swift or UI developer, so some parts may be hacky or non-idiomatic. Pull requests and suggestions are welcome!

## ✨ Features

- ✅ Editor mode: allows to define the team members, the list is persisted between sessions
- ✅ Idle mode: choose who is present today, configure the counter value and start the daily as soon as the team is ready
- ✅ Run mode: picks the next random member from the list and counts down his time. Click NEXT to choose the next team member
